GF [GP] [PL] [memory]

Fit up to 30 Gaussian profiles to a spectrum.
The optional parameters can be entered in any order.

If any of the fit parameters are to be kept constant, this is done by
specifying them using the GP command, which is used to preset Gaussian
parameters for GF.

If "GP" is specified as any of the command parameters, but not "PL", then
the fit is done automatically, using the values set with GP.  The fit
will be done without plotting to the screen, which requires user
intervention.

If both "GP" and "PL" are specified as command parameters (in any order),
then the fit will use the parameters set in GP, but it will also be
plotted (if plotdev has been set), requiring user intervention but
enabling the quality of the fit to be judged visually.

Alternatively, the fit can be done interactively (by omitting both GP and
PL as command parameters).  The user then marks pairs of points at the
half-power points of each Gaussian to be fitted.  PLOTDEV must be set
first!

How to mark points with the cursor: 
   mouse left button or A = Add new point
       centre button or D = Delete nearest point
        right button or X = eXit - no more points to add
The coordinates returned are sorted on X

If the spectrum is of a single hydrogen recombination line from an HII
region, the electron temperature will be calculated if the continuum
antenna temperature and error estimate are present in the housekeeping,
or were set prior to command GF, using command TC.

If the memory is not given as a parameter, the user is prompted for it
unless the set memory only has data, in which case it is used.

Prior to Gaussian fitting instrumental effects must be removed by
applying a velocity window and polynomial fitting to the spectrum
baseline, as appropriate.

If logging is on (see LOG), then the Gaussian parameters from the fit are
automatically written to the file 'lines.log' in the current directory,
in a multi-column ascii format suitable for importation into a
spreadsheet.

It contains:
* housekeeping identifying the spectrum;
* the parameters of each fitted Gaussian and their uncertainties;
* the derived electron temperature and turbulent velocity if the line is
  a single hydrogen recombination line and the continuum antenna
  temperature and its uncertainty are present in the housekeeping.

A new column header line is written for each fit done because the column
header layout depends on the number of Gaussians fitted and whether the
spectrum is of a hydrogen recombination line.  The user should therefore
edit out unwanted column header lines before importing the file into a
spreadsheet.

Users should check that proper convergence has occurred in the Gaussian
fitting, by examining the position, height and width listed on screen
after each iteration cycle.  if you think proper convergence is not
occuring, provide the MG with details.

GF can be used to fit the beam from a drift scan of a point source.
The beam shape top half is very closely modelled by a Gaussian.
By using VW to limit the velocity window to the top half of the beam, an
accurate fit is obtained.  For full details on how to do this, see the 
help on GP, which is used to fix the baseline at zero before carrying out
the Gaussian fit.  
   
NOTE that doing a fit to the top half of a Gaussian only is not very
stable, and it is essential to check that that convergence to a
reasonable fit has occurred.  An alternative method of fitting to get the
height and position of the maximum is to fit a second order polynomial to
the top 1/3 of the scan.  When such a parabolic fit is done, the PO
routine will list the X,Y values of the maximum.
