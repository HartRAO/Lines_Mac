<h2>'lines' Example: analysis of OHIR monitoring spectra</h2>

These spectra were obtained on the HP1000.

<p>Use TSHA to recalculate system temperature at the middle of the
observation, for the whole file, in a do loop.

<p>Use TS to add correct the system temperature if needed, and add the error
estimate in the system temperature for spectra prior to 1990 day 399 = JD
2448230.

<p>Use RAV for all the spectra to produce a high signal to noise ratio
spectrum to see where to set baseline blocks for polynomial fitting.

<p>Use PO to fit polynomials to the baselines, in a do loop

<p>Use FD to fix "down" spectra prior to 1990 day 338 = JD 2448229, on the
whole file, in a do loop.  Note that the spectrum baseline must have been
made flat using PO prior to running FD.  FD, OHJY and ATM could all be done
in the same do loop.

<p>Use OHJY to convert spectra from K to Jy using the point source sensitivity
of the period, in a do loop.

<p>Use ATM to correct the spectrum for atmospheric absorption, in a do loop. 
Keep the output file - this is the last file with unaveraged spectra, so
that bad single spectra can be edited out if needed.

<p>Use RAV with a 1 day interval to add together sets of spectra recorded on
the same day.  Keep the output file.

<p>Use SF to shift and fold frequency-shifted spectra, in a do loop.  Keep
the output file.

<p>Use TMV and TMW to output light curves for each selected range of
channels.
