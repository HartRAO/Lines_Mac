FT [memory]

Fast Fourier Transform the data in the specified memory.

The number of points to be tranformed must be 2**N,
i.e. the spectrum must not have been windowed.

The data must also be evenly spaced.

Faulty autocorrelation spectrometer channels can then be set to zero
using the AD (alter data) function.  A second FT operation then returns
the cleaned spectrum.

If the memory is not given as a parameter, the set memory is used.
