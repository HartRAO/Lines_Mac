TMW [input file] [output file] [first spectrum] [last spectrum]

Write time series files from the specified input file of spectra.
If the first and last spectra to use are not specified, 
the whole input file will be used.

Use TMV beforehand to specify the velocity range to be output.

Set TMWVNUM beforehand to give the desired style of velocity column
header, as shown below - 
true (default) for general spreadsheet programs,
false for AXUM

The format of the output files is multicolumn ascii.
The title is in row 1,
column headers are in row 2, 
and the JD-2440000 followed by data values in subsequent rows.

The output files are suited to importing into spreadsheet-style programs.

If the files already exist, they are overwritten, NOT appended to.

The primary file lists the flux at each velocity for each spectrum.
The values are in K if the data are in K, otherwise in Jy if the point
source sensitivity > 0, ie data have been converted to Jy.

where:

JDm2440000 is the Julian date - 2440000
-44.274    is the channel velocity written in a form suitable for use as
           a column header for XESS, as a normal floating point number
Vm44p274   is the channel velocity written in a form suitable for use as
           a column header for AXUM, with V for velocity, m for -, p for .
           Note that the format in the fourth output file is designed for
           use in contour plotting of irregular data in AXUM.


The second output file, with added suffix "2",
lists the estimated error in the flux at each velocity for each spectrum: 
The error is calculated using both the rms noise in the spectrum and the
error due to the uncertainty in the calibration signal.  This gives an
uncertainty which is proportional to the amplitude of the line.
The values are in K if the data are in K, otherwise in Jy if the point
source sensitivity > 0, ie data have been converted to Jy.

The fourth file, with added suffix "4",
lists the intensity channel by channel within the selected velocity range
for each observation.

It is needed if making a contour plot of the time series using AXUM (DOS)
or gri (linux) as the data are irregularly spaced in time.

Note that the column headers are taken directly from the housekeeping for
the spectra, and may not import properly as column headers in Axum -
these may have to be added after importing the data.

From 2000/09 the columns are space-delimited not comma delimited,
as gri currently does not like comma-delimited values (after discussion
with its author this should change in future versions)
