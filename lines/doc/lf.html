LF [file] [first spectrum] [last spectrum]

List the contents of an ascii spectra file on screen.

A brief summary of the housekeeping is given,
at one line per spectrum.

If the first and last spectra to list are not given,
the whole file is listed.

typical output is:

LINES>lf m17.asc
 list file m17.asc
 ASCII spectra file
 m17.asc at spectrum 1
 Rec Object           Date       Scan  Freq   BW Pol  HA S F Py Av  PSS  BU

 file ends after spectrum  2 in m17.asc

where:

Mem	memory number in lines
Object	name of the object
Date	date of the observation, YEAR-MONTH-DAY
Scan	"Scan" or observation number
Freq	Line rest frequency in MHz to nearest whole number
BW	original bandwidth of the spectrum, in MHz
Pol	polarization (0=unknown)
HA	Hour Angle of the observation, in degrees
S	smoothing applied to the spectrum, 0 = none
F	has frequency-shifted spectrum been folded? 0 = no, 1 = yes
Py	order of polynomial fitted to the spectrum baseline
Av	number of spectra that have been averaged to form this one
PSS	point source sensitivity in Jy/K used to scale spectrum to Jy
BU	brightness units of the data
