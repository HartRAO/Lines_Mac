TS [corrected system temperature] [error in Tys] [memory]

Correct the on-source system temperature and rescale the spectrum by 
the ratio of the new to old system temperatures.
Also enter or correct the error estimate in Tsys.

This should be done on individual spectra, not average spectra.

The estimated RMS noise in the spectrum is automatically recalculated.

If Tsys or the error in Tsys are not specified,
the user is prompted for them.

If the memory is not given as a parameter, the set memory is used.

example:
   
ts 35.5 0.2
