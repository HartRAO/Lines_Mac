AP [pol1 memory] [pol2 memory]

Add orthogonal polarizations of the same spectrum for total intensity.

The data in the second memory is added to that in the first.

The date and times of the two data must match.

The system temperatures are averaged and the rms noise in the total
intensity spectrum is recalculated.

If the memories are not specified the user is prompted for them.

example:
   
ap 1 2


Note that one would only do this with masers that are unpolarized, eg
methanol.  Hydroxyl maser are strongly circularly polarized so these are not
combined but the two polarizations are usually displayed superimposed using
different line styles (eg. solid and dashed).
