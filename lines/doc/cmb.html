CMB [memory with signal bandpass] [memory with ref bandpass] [to memory]

Combine two bandpasses to give the band-corrected spectrum 

In the NCCS bandpasses are saved individually, whereas on the HP1000,
two bandpasses were divided to give a band-corrected spectrum.
   
This command divides the individually saved signal and reference
bandpasses to produce the band-corrected spectrum.  This permits modes of 
spectroscopic observing that were not available on the HP1000, for
example using one reference bandpass for a number of different signal 
bandpasses.
   
For position-switched spectra the bandpasses typically look like this:
       signal                         reference
    _____/\_____                     ____________
   /            \                   /            \
CMB produces a spectrum looking like this:
    _____/\_____   


For frequency-switched spectra the bandpasses typically look like this:
       signal                         reference
    _/\_________                     _________/\_   
   /            \                   /            \
CMB produces a spectrum looking like this:
    _/\__   

This has to be done individually for each polarization
   
If the two polarizations are to be added to give the total intensity, 
CMB must be done first.

if the parameters are not specified are the command mnemonic, the user
is prompted for them.
   
example:
   
# combine lcp bandpasses in mem 1 and mem 3 and write result to mem 5
cmb 1 3 5
# combine rcp bandpasses in mem 2 and mem 4 and write result to mem 6
cmb 2 4 6


note that for frequency-switched spectra, the choice of which is signal 
and which is the reference is somewhat arbitrary and
  cmb 1 3 5
and
  cmb 3 1 5 
should produce the same result.
