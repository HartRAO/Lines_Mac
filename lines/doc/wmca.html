WMCA [to file] [from memory]

Write spectrum to multi-column ascii file for import to spreadsheets
or plotting programs.

The first line of the output file contains :
# to make "grace" or "xmgr" ignore the line
the name of the object, 
the date of the observation,
the intensity units,
the RA and DEC of the equinox, and
the equinox of the coordinates
.

The second line of the file contains :
# to make "grace" or "xmgr" ignore the line
the column headers

The #'s noted above can be edited out if desired for programs less
inflexible than "grace" or "xmgr" when importing data

The third and subsequent lines of the file contain either the 
velocity in km/s and spectrum intensity, or
the channel number and fourier transform intensity.

Files are always appended to, not over-written.

If the output file name is not given, the user is prompted for it.
A filename suffix of .MCA should be used.

If the memory is not given as a parameter, the set memory is used.

Sample output file:

 # 12.89+0.49 on 2000-01-30T12:15:12 in Jy at RA  272.23 DEC -17.537 of 1950.
