GW [output file name]

Write data and fitted Gaussian profiles to a disc file in a multicolumn
ascii format suitable for importation into a spreadsheet.

The aim of this operation is to permit plotting of individual Gaussians
with the spectrum to which they were fitted.  By contrast, LINES plots
the sum of the Gaussians over the spectrum.

If no file name is specified, the output file is 'gausfile.out',
to which results are always appended.

examples:
   
gw			! uses default output file name
   
gw  srcnamegausfit.out	! uses user supplied file name
