Correct the spectrum amplitude for atmospheric absorption

At long wavelenghts (restfreq < 10GHz) this uses the SLAP formula:  

   ABSORB = 1D0 / DEXP(0.0069D0*(1D0/DSIN(ALTRAD)-1D0))

Around the water vapour frequency of 22.2GHz the SKA correction
making use of the atmospheric precipitable water vapour [PWV, mm] is applied
This can be calculated approxiamtely from the ground temperature and humidity
but is better calculated from the GPS total zenith delay corrected for atmospheric pressure
for HartRAO this can be downloaded from SUOMINET
   

The correction calculated for elevation  / altitude of
the antenna at the middle of the observation is applied,
using the housekeeping information with the spectrum.

If a correction has already been applied to the spectrum
this will be reversed before the new correction is applied.

The atmospheric correction should be applied to individual spectra, 
not average spectra.

This function requires housekeeping information to be present to obtain the
elevation angle.  This works for spectra from the HP1000 but not yet for
spectra from the NCCS.

To set the PWV for the atmospheric correction, use the SET command:

SET PWV [value in mm]

   e.g.

SET PWV 27.3
