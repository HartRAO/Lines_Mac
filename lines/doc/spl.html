SPL [number of splines to fit] [mem]

Fit cubic splines through the data and subtract from the data.

If the number of splines is specified and is greater than 0, 
the fit will be automatic and not interactive
   
If the memory is to be specified as a parameter, then one 
character must be used as a placeholder for the number of splines.
This should be a 0 for an interactive fit.

If plotting devices have been set, the fitted splines will be displayed
superimposed on the data, followed by the data - splines.

Examples:
   
interactive fit using default memory:
   
spl
   
   
interactive fit using memory 6:
   
spl 0 6
   
   
automatic fit of 7 splines to data in default memory
   
spl 7 
   
   
automatic fit of 10 splines to data in memory 3
   
spl 10 3
