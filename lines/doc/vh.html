VH [velocity] [memory]

Calculate the height of the datum at the specified velocity.
The ordinate at the abscissa closest to the specified velocity is used.

If spectrum is frequency shifted and has not been folded, the height in
of the corresponding peak in the "down" spectrum is also found.

If the velocity is not given, the user is prompted for it.

If the memory is not given, the set memory is used.

example:
   
vh 27.315
