GCP [CLEAR] [SHOW] [polynomial coefficients]

enter gain curve polynomial coefficients

The gain curve of the telescope is modelled as the gain as a function of
hour angle (in degrees) for a specific declination and frequency. 
Experimental data are fitted with a low order polynomial (<7).  This is
used to obtain the gain correction - the reciprocal of the measured gain
- at the hour angle of the observation.
