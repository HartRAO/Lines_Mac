<h2>Smoothing drift scans</h2>

Shown below is a typical drift scan across a continuum radio source, in this
case through the calibrator 3C123 at 13cm wavelength using the 26m
radio telescope.

In this case we are fortunate in that there are no radio frequency
interference (RFI) spikes that we might want to remove using the median
filter <a href="mf.html">mf 2</a>.

<p> We want to measure the height of the scan above the first nulls, in
order to determine the antenna temperature of the source, and get an
estimate of the uncertainty in the measurement.

<p>We can fit a parabola (polynomial of order 2) through the top of the peak
to measure its height Ta using <a href="po.html">po</a>, and the fitting
routine will give an error estimate based on the (assumed white) noise in
the scan:

<p>
Ta = 2.8581 +- 0.0489 K
<p>

These data were sampled at intervals of 0.08 seconds, ie 12 samples per
second.  However the radiometer sensitivity equation tells us:
<br>
<pre>
  dTa = Tsys / sqrt (receiver bandwidth * post-detection integration time)
</pre>

<p>
We can digitally reduce the noise in the data by increasing the
post-detection integration time, i.e. smoothing the data.  Three useful
options built into 'lines' are:
<br>
* hamming smoothing (<a href="hm.html">hm</a>) <br>
* median filtering (<a href="mf.html">mf</a>) <br>
* smoothing with a running mean of N points (<a href="sm.html">sm</a>).
<p>

The first two operators (hm and mf) are of fixed, relatively short length.
With sm any desired smoothing length up to the length of the data set could
be specified; but is there an upper limit to the smoothing length that
should be used?

<p>
Experimentation shows that smoothing the data so that there are just 10
smoothing lengths across the half-power beamwidth reduces the estimate of
the peak height by less than 1 percent.  We can test this with these data.

<p> In the example shown, there are about 1100 points  across the half-power
beamwidth. This was determined using the lines function '<a
href="pgc.html">pgc</a>', which gives the left half-power point at pixel ~900
and the right half-power point at pixel ~2000.

We therefore make the following test comparisons, fitting a
second order polynomial to the data unsmoothed versus the the data smoothed
by hm, mf 2, sm 50 (about 20 smoothing lengths across the half-power
beamwidth) and sm 110 (about 10 smoothing lengths across the half-power
beamwidth):
<br>
<pre>
unsmoothed: Ta = 2.8581 +- 0.0489 K
hm:         Ta = 2.8584 +- 0.0409 K
mf 2:       Ta = 2.8579 +- 0.0376 K
sm 50:      Ta = 2.8565 +- 0.0075 K
sm 110:     Ta = 2.8533 +- 0.0035 K
</pre>

<p>Even the very heavy smoothing with a 110 point running mean has had a
very small effect on the measured Ta, but the uncertainty in the estimate is
much smaller.  

<p>But lets check what happens if we smooth even more:<br>
<pre>
sm 500:     Ta = 2.7385 +- 0.0014 K
sm 1000:    Ta = 2.4242 +- 0.0007 K
</pre>

<p>A smoothing length of 500 points produces a very small statistical error,
but it has oversmoothed the data, reducing the peak height by 0.12 K = 4%.  The
effect is even worse with a smoothing length of 1000 points.  Hence it is
important not to oversmooth.

<p>We need to note that the sample data used here do not show any effects from
weather or receiver gain variations.  These effects may dominate the
measurement uncertainty over the statistical random fluctuations,
particularly for weak sources. 

<p>Two important points to remember that affect the smoothing length to use are:
<ul>
<li>The telescope beamwidth is proportional to the observing wavelength. 
The example shown was taken at 13cm wavelength.  For example, at 6cm
wavelength, the beamwidth is roughly half, and there will be only half as
many points across the half-power beamwidth.  At 1.3cm wavelength there will
only be one tenth as many points across the half-power beamwidth!
<li>The length of the drift scan depends on 1/cosine(source declination). 
So a drift scan across an object at 60 degrees south will take twice as long
as one at 0 declination, and there will be twice as many points across the
half-power beamwidth.
</ul>
