LM [first memory] [last memory]

Summarize the contents of all non-empty memories.

If the first memory only is specified, it alone is listed.

typical output is:

Mem Object          Date       Scan  Freq   BW Pol  HA S F Py Av  PSS  BU
  7 M17            1996-10-29 19536  4874 2.56   0  -4 0 0  3  1   0.0 K 
  8 M17            1996-10-29 19536  4874 2.56   0  -4 0 0  3  1   0.0 K 
  6 of  8 memories are empty

where:

Mem	memory number in lines
Object	name of the object
Date	date of the observation, YEAR-MONTH-DAY
Scan	"Scan" or observation number
Freq	Line rest frequency in MHz to nearest whole number
BW	original bandwidth of the spectrum, in MHz
Pol	polarization (0=unknown)
HA	Hour Angle of the observation, in degrees
S	smoothing applied to the spectrum, 0 = none
F	has frequency-shifted spectrum been folded? 0 = no, 1 = yes
Py	order of polynomial fitted to the spectrum baseline
Av	number of spectra that have been averaged to form this one
PSS	point source sensitivity in Jy/K used to scale spectrum to Jy
BU	brightness units of the data
