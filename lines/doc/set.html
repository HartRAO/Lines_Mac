SET [parameter] [new value]

List or alter values of parameters used by the program.
If no parameter is given the current values are listed.
If the parameter is given but no new value, 
the user is asked to enter a new value.

MEMRD        memory into which data is read from a disc file
             default = MAXMEM-1 = 11

MEMSET       memory on which operations are done by default 
             default = MAXMEM = 12

PLOTDEV      interactive plotting device, e.g. /xwin for Xwindow on Linux
             see the PGPLOT manual for more info on settings relating to
             plotting.  Type SET PLOTDEV with no arguments to get a list
             of devices.  Select from "interactive devices"

PLOTPS       hardcopy plotting device, normally postscript file/plot type
             e.g. plotfile.ps/vcps for colour, portrait orientation. 
             Type SET PLOTPS with no arguments to get a list of devices. 
             Select from "non-interactive devices".
             Alternative output file types include gif (landscape) and
             vgif (portrait orientation).   
             If a file name is not specified, it will be written to a
             file called "pgplot".

NXSUB        number of columns into which the plot area is subdivided
             default = 1

NYSUB        number of rows into which the plot area is subdivided
             default = 1

PGPROMPT     prompt user to start the next screen plot, True or False
             default = False

COLOUR       plot colour
             Black=0 White=1 Red=2 Green=3 Blue=4 Cyan=5 Magenta=6 Yellow=7
             default screen plots are black on white to match postscript

LINE         line type for plot
             None=0 Full=1 Dashed=2 Dotdash=3 Dotted=4 Dashdotdotdot=5
             default = 1

WIDTH        line width, in units of 0.13 mm
             default = 1

SYMBOL       symbol drawn at each point
             default = 1, for a dot

CHARSIZE     character size
             default height = 1.0 equals 1/40 height of view surface

FONT         plot text font: normal=1 roman=2 italic=3 script=4
             default = 2, for roman

XPMIN        plot X axis minimum: set > XPMAX for normalised plot
             default = 0

XPMAX        plot X axis maximum: set < XPMIN for normalised plot
             default = -1; with XPMIN, this autoscales the X axis

YPMIN        plot Y axis minimum: set > YPMAX for normalised plot
             default = 0   

YPMAX        plot Y axis maximum: set < YPMIN for normalised plot
             default = -1; with YPMIN, this autoscales the Y axis
                
CAPTION      plot caption; only used if CAP is set as PL parameter
             default = blank

ADDIDENT     add plot identifier with name date time
             to lower right corner of plot, True or False
             default = True

ADDTSYS      add hour angle, system temperature data to plot, 
             on second line of caption, True or False
             default = True

TMWVNUM      write TMW velocity column headers as numbers, True or False
   	     number form (-17.321) is suitable for some spreadsheets,
   	     character form (Vm17p321) is needed for AXUM 
   	     default = True

TELLONG	     telescope longitude in degrees, used for HA calculation
             note that east is positive, west is negative
             default = HartRAO = +27.685

TELLAT       telescope latitude in degrees, used for HA calculation
             note that north is positive, south is negative
             default = HartRAO = -25.886

PWV          atmospheric precipitable water vapour [mm] for 
             atmospheric absorption correction at 22GHz
             default = 0.0
