TC [continuum antenna temperature] [error in Tc] [memory]

Set the continuum antenna temperature and error estimate.

For use in calculating the electron temperature in an HII region
where the spectrum is a hydrogen recombination line.

If the continuum temperature and error are not specified,
the user is prompted for them.

If the memory is not given as a parameter, the set memory is used.

example:
   
tc 2.4 0.15
