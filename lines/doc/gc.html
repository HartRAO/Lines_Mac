GC [GCP] [gain correction] [memory]

apply gain correction to spectrum, optionally using coeffs from GCP
   
The telescope gain is a function of hour angle, declination and frequency.
Gain curves can be constructed to give the gain relative to that at the 
zenith meridian for a given declination, by means of observations of a 
source at the given declination, from horizon to horizon.
These data need to be normalised to give a maximum value of unity.
   
The coefficients of a polynomial fitted to the gain curve can be used to
compute the relative gain at the hour angle of any observation at that
declination.  The polynomial fit (PO) can be done using lines, after
reading in the hour angle and relative gain from a multi-column ascii
file (RMCA).
   
The gain correction is the reciprocal of the measured normalised gain as
a function of hour angle (in degrees).  The value applied is stored in
the housekeeping.  The default value is unity.
   
examples:
   
GC GCP	apply gain correction to spectrum in default memory using
        the coefficients read in via GCP, based on the hour angle of
        the observation stored in the housekeeping of the spectrum.

GC 1.053     apply a gain correction of 1.053 to the spectrum in the
             default memory

GC 1.0	restore spectrum in the default memory to its uncorrected
        value
