PC [intensity north] [south] [east] [west] [on source] [hpbw] [memory]

Calculate the pointing correction to the on-source intensity from
the intensities at the half power points of the beam and on-source.

If the intensities are not given, the user is prompted for them.

The units of the halfpower beamwidth are decimal degrees.

If the halfpower beamwidth is not given then it is computed from the rest
frequency for the specified memory - the antenna is assumed to be 26m
diameter Hartbeesthoek telescope.

If the memory is not specified, the set memory is used.

If the memory is specified as 0 (zero) then the pointing correction
calculation does not use any data in the memories, only what has been
entered in calling the routine.

The pointing correction is calculated preferentially from the values 
at the half power points in each direction.  If one of these is too weak 
then the on source intensity and larger half power point value is used.

If the beam offsets used for the observations were inaccurate, 
the user is shown how to correct them.

If the measurements were made to find the position of an unknown source,
the coordinates for the location of the source are calculated. (Only
where the source coordinates are available in memory).

To apply the pointing correction for the amplitude to the spectrum,
use the MC command.  This is not done automatically.  The command:
MC PC applies the pointing correction


An example of the output from the PC command is shown below:

  Use NORTH + SOUTH  =      5.7 mdeg

  If beam offsets are in error:
    New HA  offset = old + -0.005 deg
    New Dec offset = old + -0.006 deg

The corrections are shown in tabular form in the two lines starting

so that they can easily be cut-and-pasted into a spreadsheet for further
analysis.
