FT [memory]

   Fourier transform the data in the specified memory.

   The number of points to be tranformed must be 2**N,
   i.e. the spectrum must not have been windowed.

   Faulty autocorrelation spectrometer channels can then be set to zero
   using the AD (alter data) function.  A second FT operation then returns
   the cleaned spectrum.

   If the memory is not given as a parameter, the set memory is used.
