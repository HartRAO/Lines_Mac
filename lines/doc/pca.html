PCA [velocity] 

Automated calculation of the pointing correction to the on-source
intensity from the intensities at the half power points of the beam and
on-source.

The user is required to read the spectra into memories before calling
this function.

For position-switched spectra use:
	mem 1	north
	mem 2	south
        mem 3   east 
        mem 4   west
        mem 5   on source
For frequency-switched spectra use:
	mem 1	north + south
        mem 2	east + west
        mem 3	on source
The spectra must have flat baselines and be in the same units.

PCA searches for a maximum in the data over seven points centred on the
velocity given by the user.  It is important that the line peak in the
offset spectra fall within this search range, otherwise the pointing
correction applied will be incorrect.  This can be checked by using
option LD <MEM> to list the data in each of the memories used for the
pointing calculation, and noting the channel number at which the NSEW
peaks occur.  PL <MEM> will give a visual display of the data in each
memory.  If "debug" is turned before running PCA, the portion data from
each memory being searched for the maximum will listed to screen. If the
line peak is more than 3 channels away from its position in the on-source
spectra, contact the author!

Function PC is then called to calculate the value of the pointing
correction.

To apply the pointing correction for the amplitude to the spectrum,
use the MC command.  This is not done automatically.

This can be done in an automated way however by giving the command
MC pc mem
whereupon the last calculated pointing correction will be applied to 
the spectrum in the specified memory.


Sample command files to automate pointing correction and apply it to the
average on source spectrum, and save to a new disk file:
