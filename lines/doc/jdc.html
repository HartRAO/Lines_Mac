JDC [JDP] [gain correction] [date offset] [memory]

apply gain correction to spectrum, normally using coefficients from JDP
   
The telescope gain as a function of time (Julian Date) may have residual
errors that can be modelled using a polynomial fit to data from
non-varying sources over the period in question.  
   
The data from the non-varying sources should be normalised by dividing by
the mean so that each normalised set of data has a mean of 1.  These data
sets can then be interleaved and fitted with a polynomial.  The units of
time must be Julian Days - 2440000 (JD-2440000).  This is how data are
are written out by function TMW in lines.
   
The coefficients of a polynomial fitted to these data can be used to
correct the relative gain at the date any observation.
   
The polynomial fit can be done using function PO in lines, after
reading in the JD-2440000 and relative gain from a two column ascii
file using function RMCA.
   
The gain correction is the reciprocal of the measured normalised gain as
a function of JD-2440000.
   
For higher order polynomial fits, the 'X' values may be too large for a
stable polynomial fit if X = JD-2440000.  An extra offset may be
subtracted to achieve a stable polynomial fit.  This value is entered 
as the 'date offset' parameter, in days, and must have the correct sign.
For example if an extra 11500 days was subtracted from JD-2440000, then
this value is entered as -11500.
   
Note that the value of the correction applied by JDC is not stored in the
housekeeping when the spectrum is written to a '.asc' file.


examples:
   
JDC JDP	
	apply gain correction to spectrum in default memory using
        the coefficients read in via JDP, based on the Julian Date
        of the observation stored in the housekeeping of the spectrum.

GC 1.053
	apply a gain correction of 1.053 to the spectrum in the
	default memory
