HM [memory]

Hamming smooth the spectrum in the specified memory.

If the memory is not given as a parameter, the set memory is used.

The Hamming function is a moving window which smoothes using this 
algorithm:
   
   Ynew(I) = 0.23*Yold(I-1) + 0.46*Yold(I) + 0.23*Yold(I+1)

It is effective in reducing noise, but will subtley alter the shape of a 
line profile, which may be a significant consideration if it is intended 
to fit Gaussians to the profile.  It will broaden narrow lines (ie lines
appearing in only a few channels) and reduce their peak amplitude.
   
The Hamming function has very low sidelobes, in contrast to unsmoothed 
spectra, where the sidelobes are those of a rectangular window.
   
If data with spikes (outliers) need to be cleaned, try using median
filtering (function <a href="mf.html">MF<a/>).
