VW [start velocity] [end velocity] [memory]

Change the velocity window for the spectrum in the specified memory,
ie the velocity range that is taken to contain valid data.
   
It can be used to exclude the ends of the data where unwanted edge
effects or interference are present.

  
If the start velocity and end velocity are not given, 
and an interactive plot device is in use,
the data are plotted on screen and the user is prompted to use
the mouse buttons to choose the wanted data range.

If the start velocity and end velocity are not given, 
and no interactive plot device is specified,
the user is prompted for them.

If the memory is not given as a parameter, the set memory is used.

example:
   
vw -27 45
