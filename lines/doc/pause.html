   Pause can be used in two ways:
   1. Sleep for a specified number of seconds.
      This allows automated scanning of plots without having to press "Enter'

   2. Continue processing on pressing Enter, or press [Q] to return control to user
      In this case 'sleep-seconds' was not given as a command-line parameter

   Pause is used in a DO loop, for instance when viewing plots on screen repeatedly,
   these will otherwise scroll too fast to be seen by the user.

   examples:

   DO I 1 100 1
	RA SPECTRA.ASC I I NEW 
	PL
*       resume when user presses Enter or Q Enter
	PAUSE
   END

   DO I 1 100 1
	RA SPECTRA.ASC I I NEW 
	PL
*       timed sleep for three seconds
	PAUSE 3
   END

   Can also be used during the processing of a command file.
   
   If "Q" is typed before pressing the "Enter" key, control will revert
   to the user.
