LOG [on/off]

turn logging or results to "lines.log" on or off 

Results of potentially lasting interest to the user can be written to the
log file 'lines.log' in the current directory if logging is turned on.

Note that the default state is for logging to be on.

The log file records input commands, enabling command files for repeated
operations to be created by selective editing of lines.log.

Gaussian fitting and line integral results are written to the log file
in a multicolumn format that can be imported into a spreadsheet after
selective editing.

Do not try to view lines.log with "less", "more", an editor, or other
file viewer, while lines is running.  Lines or the other program will
freeze or crash.
    
It may be useful to rename "lines.log" after a data reduction session in
order to preserve it with a suitable name, or to prevent "lines.log"
from growing too large.
    
Example:
    
log off
