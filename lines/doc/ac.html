AC [constant] [memory]

Add a constant to the spectrum in the specified memory.

If the constant is not specified, the user is prompted for it.

If the memory is not given as a parameter, the set memory is used.

This function can be used to plot a set of spectra on one page:
add an offset each spectrum,
set XPMIN and XPMAX to cover the full range of the data with offsets
PL add to add the spectra successively to the plot of the first.


Example:  add 2.0 to all data in memory 3
   
ac 2.0 3
