WA [to file] [from memory]

Write a spectrum to an ascii-format file from the specified memory.
The file format is similar to FITS but is unblocked.

A list of key words and associated values are followed by a data array.
The files are in plain ascii and are editable.

Files are always appended to, not over-written.

If the output file name is not given, the user is prompted for it.
A filename suffix of .ASC should be used.

If the memory is not given as a parameter, the set memory is used.

example:
   
wa newfile.asc
