JY [PSS in Jy/K] [memory]

Convert the spectrum from Kelvin to Jansky, 
i.e. scale by the Point Source Sensitivity, to get it into absolute units.
   
Or change the K to Jy conversion factor (point source sensitivity) used 
previously.

If an invalid K to Jy factor is given, or none is given, then the user is
prompted for it.

If the memory is not given as a parameter, the set memory is used.

The point source sensitivity is found by observing standard calibrator
radio sources, e.g. from Ott et al.

For spectra obtained with the old correlator on the HP1000, only one
polarization was recorded, and the spectra were multiplied by 2xPSS/Pol
to obtain total intensity in Jy.
   
For data obtained with new correlator on the NCCS, both left- and
right-handed circular polarization is normally available, and the data
are scaled by the PSS per polarization and then added to obtain the total
intensity.

'JY' is useful when working with a few spectra, but for converting many
spectra, using PSSF followed by PSS will be quicker.

example:
   
jy 5.35
