FD [memory]

Fix the amplitude of "down" HBK spectrum observed prior to 1990 d 338

This correction is needed for spectra obtained by frequency-switching,
producing "up" and "down" spectra.

It must be done before folding or averaging spectra, or converting to Jy.

It must be carried out on spectra in which the baselines have first been
flattened by fitting a polynomial.

Spectra obtained after 1990 d 338 = JD 2448229.5 will not be altered if
the function is called.

If the memory is not specified the set memory (MEMSET) will be used.
