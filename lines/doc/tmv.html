TMV [start velocity] [end velocity] or [SHOW] or [CLEAR]

Set velocity ranges for writing to a time series file.

If these are not set before running TMW, 
the full velocity range of the spectrum will be written out.

Several blocks may be specified.

examples:
   
tmv -37 -24		! set velocity range
tmv 0 12		! set second velocity range
TMV SHOW    		! show existing ranges
TMV CLEAR   		! clear existing ranges
