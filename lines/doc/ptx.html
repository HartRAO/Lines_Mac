PTX Add labels / comments / text to the current plot.

Labels are added interactively.
The user is prompted for the text string to add to the plot.
After entering the text, the mouse is used to mark the position 
of the lower left corner at which the text must start.

Up to twenty text strings may be entered at a time;
to enter more, rerun PTX.

If a postscript plotfile has been set, the text will be added to it.

Positioning of the text appears imprecise if portrait-orientation
plotting has been selected with multiple plots per page.
