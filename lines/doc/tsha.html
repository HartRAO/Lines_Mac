TSHA [memory]

For early Hart OHIR observations only, pre 1990 day 353 (JD2448244.974)

For spectra in which the system temperature was calculated at the end of
the observation, recompute the system temperature at the middle of the
observation, using the measured change in system temperature vs zenith
angle.
   
This must be done on individual spectra, not averaged spectra

Rescale the spectrum by the ratio of the new to old system temperatures. 

If the hour angle at the end of the observation was not recorded, add it
to the housekeeping.

The estimated RMS noise in the spectrum is automatically recalculated.

If the memory is not given as a parameter, the set memory is used.
