AP [pol1 memory] [pol2 memory]

Add orthogonal polarizations of the same spectrum for total intensity.

The data in the second memory is added to that in the first.

The date and times of the two data must match.

The system temperatures are averaged and the rms noise in the total
intensity spectrum is recalculated.

If the memories are not specified the user is prompted for them.

example:
   
ap 1 2
