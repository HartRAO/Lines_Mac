JY [Kelvin to Jansky factor] [memory]

   Convert the spectrum from Kelvin to Jansky, or change the K to Jy
   conversion factor (point source sensitivity).

   If an invalid K to Jy factor is given, or none is given, then the user is
   prompted for it.

   If the memory is not given as a parameter, the set memory is used.

   example:
   
   jy 24.2
