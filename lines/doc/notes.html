<h2>'lines' General Notes</h2>


<h3>Purpose of 'lines'</h3>

The original purpose of the program was to reduce and analyse spectra from
the 26-m Hartebeesthoek radio telescope.  However its scope has broadened so
that, for example, drift scans of radio calibrator sources can be reduced. 
Some functions are useful in the analysis of other types of data, so the
program is able to read any data in a simple multi-column ascii format.

<h3>Commands</h3>

<b>Command parameters</b>. Many commands take parameters; the user is
prompted for the parameters if they are omitted, but intelligent defaults
are used where possible.  While commands are generally shown in the 'help
files in upper case, this is for legibility - the commands are not case
sensitive.  Note that file names are case-sensitive however.

<p><b>System commands</b>. Any command can be passed to the operating system
using the <a href="sy.html">SY</a> command, for example permitting command
files to be edited or output files renamed or edited while in 'lines'. 
System commands must be lower case.


<h3>Importing data</h3>

<b>Spectra from the HP1000</b>. The program was originally designed to read
spectra from the HP1000 mini-computer that used to operate the 26-m
Hartebeesthoek telescope.  These were originally recorded in a binary
format, but were converted to a FITS-like ascii format, which are read using
the <a href="ra.html">RA</a> / <a href="rav.html">RAV</a> commands.

<p><b>General data</b>. However to make it more useful, 'lines' can also
read data from multi-column ascii files as can be exported from
spreadsheets, using the <a href="rmca.html">RMCA</a> command.  In this case the
user specifies which columns contain the X and Y data.  As the housekeeping
accompanying the HP spectra is then not available, some commands needing
certain housekeeping will not work.

<p><b>Spectra from the NCCS</b>. The 'New Control Computer System' (NCCS)
currently controlling the 26-m telescope writes data to FITS-format files. 
Lines cannot read these currently, but programs are available to convert
these files to ascii files that 'lines' can read.  'spfits2asc' converts
spectra files to ascii.  These files are read using <a
href="rncsv.html">RNCSV</a>.  Spectra from the NCCS are normally dual
polarization, so there are two data sets two be imported from each file, one
for left-circular polarization and one for right-circular polarization. 
These are read in together and stored in separate memories.  After separate
data reduction of each polarization, they may be added to give the total
intensity.

<p><b>Continuum scans from the NCCS</b>. The simplest continuum radiometry
mode of the NCCS is the drift scan.  'drift_fits2asc' converts drift scans
to ascii for 'lines'.  These are read using <a href="rmca.html">RMCA</a>. 
As noted above, these are dual polarized so there are two sets of data to
reduce.  In addition, if scans were done to check the north-south pointing,
there will be three pairs of data in the file, taken through the north
half-power point of the beam, through the centre of the beam, and through
the south half-power point of the beam.

<p><b>Multiple memories</b> are available for storing data.  At present
there are 12 memories, of which memory 11 is used to read spectra (<a
href="set.html">SET</a> MEMRD alters this) and memory 12 is the standard
operating memory to which operations default if the memory to use is not
specified (<a href="set.html">SET</a> MEMSET alters this), leaving memories 1
to 10 available for general use. Commands <a href="cp.html">CP</a> and <a
href="mv.html">MV</a> copy and move data from one memory to another.



<h3>Mouse functions in screen plots</h3>

The <b>velocity window</b> ie. the range of X values that you want to work
with, can be marked by mouse clicks on the displayed data, using the <a
href="vw.html">VW</a> command.

<p><b>Velocity limits for the line integral</b> command <a
href="int.html">INT</a> can be marked with the mouse.

<p><b>Baseline blocks for polynomial fitting</b> can be marked with the
mouse or can be preset using <a href="pb.html">PB</a>.

<p><b>Gaussian profiles</b> to be fitted can be marked by mouse clicks at
the half power points of each Gaussian or can be preset using <a
href="gp.html">GP</a>.


<h3>Exporting results</h3>

<b>A log file</b> of commands and results that is written
automatically when the program runs, echoing much of what appears on screen. 
This file is called 'lines.log' and it is appended to if the program is
rerun.  It is not overwritten.  Logging can be turned off.

<p><b>Gaussian profile output</b>. The profiles of each Gaussian fitted can
be written to a multi-column ascii format file for post-analysis replotting
in a spreadsheet, using the <a href="gw.html">GW</a> command.

<p><b>Results of Gaussian fits</b>, as well as being shown on screen, can
be written to a multi-column ascii format file for importation to a
spreadsheet for further analysis or plotting.

<p><b>Results of line integral calculations</b>, as well as being shown on
screen, are automatically written to a multi-column ascii format disc file
for importation to a spreadsheet for further analysis or plotting.


<h3>Customising plots</h3>

<b>Plot output</b> The <a href="set.html">SET</a> PLOTPS command enables
plots to be written to disc files in postscript or other formats for later
hardcopy or publication.

<p><b>Plot page subdivision</b> Plot pages can be subdivided into any number
of rows and columns using the <a href="set.html">SET</a> NXSUB and <a
href="set.html">SET</a> NYSUB commands, providing multiple spectra per page.

<p><b>Plot attributes</b> can be customised in a number of ways 
using <a href="set.html">SET</a> e.g.:
  <ul>
  <li>line colour (SET COLOUR), 
  <li>line style (SET LINE), 
  <li>line width (SET WIDTH), 
  <li>symbol drawn at each point (SET SYMBOL),
  <li>character size (SET CHARSIZE), 
  <li>font (SET FONT), 
  <li>X and Y minima and maxima (SET XPMIN, SET XPMAX, SET YPMIN, SET YPMAX), 
  <li>alternative caption (SET CAPTION)
  <li>user identifier (SET ADDIDENT)
  </ul>

<b>Adding text to plots</b>.  Comments can be added anywhere on plots using
the <a href="ptx.html">PTX</a> command; these comments can include super-
and sub-scripts and Greek characters.


<h3>Data export</h3>

<b>Ascii spectra files</b>.  The original data export format is the
FITS-like but unblocked ascii format, created by the <a
href="wa.html">WA</a> command.  This permits many spectra to appended to one
file, and any simple text editor can be used on these files.  The files
comprise blocks of keywords with their attended vaues, one per line,
followed by a block of data.

<p><b>Simple multicolumn ascii format</b> files are suitable for import into
spreadsheets or plotting programs, and are writeen via the <a
href="wmca.html">WMCA</a> command.

<p><b>Spectra output for time series analysis</b>. as a time series in
multicolumn ascii format for import into time series analysis programs or
phase lag analysis programs or plotting programs, by means of the <a
href="tmv.html">TMV</a> and <a href="tmw.html">TMW</a> commands.


<h3>Program automation</h3>

<b>Command files</b>, i.e. sets of commands stored in a disk file, can
executed at at time using the <a href="inp.html">INP</a> command.  For
automated reduction, command files must specify all the necessary parameters
so that processing does not hang, waiting for a response from the user.

<p><b>A command file</b> can be specified in the run string e.g. "lines
cmdfile" and this will execute on startup.

<p><b>The <a href="do.html">DO</a> loop</b> command permits repetitive
operations to be automated


<h3>Origin of 'lines'</h3>

The program originally existed in simpler form on the HP1000 minicomputer
system, which was programmed in Fortran 77.  The program was rewritten for
PC's running linux, but remains in Fortran 77, which is freely available on
linux, to avoid unneccesary conversion of ported code.  The core programme
was written by Mike Gaylard.  Various routines have been imported from
external sources, such as <a
href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/">PGPLOT</a>, which provides
the graphics capability.
